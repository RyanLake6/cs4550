# Kanbas React Frontend

This is the frontend for my kanbas project. It contains the React, HTML, and CSS for the kanbas webpage.

This project was an excercise within the NEU CS 4550 Web Development class to learn react. The end goal was to mock the popular school tool [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) while learning full stack and front end development tools and languages along the way.

- It dynamically renders and stores all data with the use of a Node.js backend [here](https://github.com/RyanLake6/kanbas-node-server-app)
- Some key features:
  - Sign in page (store data for each user and render accordingly)
  - Ability to build and customize courses
  - Manage and edit accounts
  - Extended to build and edit quizzes [here](https://github.com/psaliba/quiz-react-client) and [here](https://github.com/psaliba/quiz-node-server) as part of a group
